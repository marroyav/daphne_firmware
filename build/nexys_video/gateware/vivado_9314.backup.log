INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/mam/fpga/linux/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/build/nexys_video/gateware/top.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [Synth 8-6841] Block RAM (mem_1_reg) originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
(address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute "ram_decomp = power" if BWWE is desired.)

WARNING: [Synth 8-6841] Block RAM (mem_1_reg) originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
(address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute "ram_decomp = power" if BWWE is desired.)

CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC AVAL-46] v7v8_mmcm_fvco_rule1: The current computed target frequency, FVCO, is out of range for cell MMCME2_ADV. The computed FVCO is 1500.000 MHz. The valid FVCO range for speed grade -1 is 600MHz to 1200MHz. The cell attribute values used to compute FVCO are CLKFBOUT_MULT_F = 30.000, CLKIN1_PERIOD = 10.00000, and DIVCLK_DIVIDE = 2 (FVCO = 1000 * CLKFBOUT_MULT_F/(CLKIN1_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)).
This violation may be corrected by:
  1. The timer uses timing constraints for clock period or clock frequency that affect CLKIN1 to set cell attribute CLKIN1_PERIOD, over-riding any previous value. This may already be in place and, if so this violation will be resolved once Timing is run.  Otherwise, consider modifying timing constraints to adjust the CLKIN1_PERIOD and bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  2. In the absence of timing constraints that affect CLKIN1, consider modifying the cell CLKIN1_PERIOD to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  3. If CLKIN1_PERIOD is satisfactory, modify the CLKFBOUT_MULT_F or DIVCLK_DIVIDE cell attributes to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  4. The MMCM configuration may be dynamically modified by use of DRP which is recognized by an ACTIVE signal on DCLK pin.

The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (10.000000), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (30.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (2), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Please note that this check is a Warning because the DCLK pin has an ACTIVE signal and it is assumed that dynamic control (DRP) will be exercised to put the VCO frequency into valid operating range.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-33] MMCM_adv_ClkFrequency_div_dclk: The computed value 1500.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net clk100_clk) for the VCO operating frequency of the MMCME2_ADV site MMCME2_ADV_X1Y0 (cell MMCME2_ADV) falls outside the operating range of the MMCM VCO frequency for this device (600.000 - 1200.000 MHz). The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (10.000000), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (30.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (2), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Please note that this check is a Warning because the DCLK pin has an ACTIVE signal and it is assumed that dynamic control (DRP) will be exercised to put the VCO frequency into valid operating range.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net CLKB0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ISERDESE2_i_1/O, cell ISERDESE2_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT ISERDESE2_i_1 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ISERDESE2, ISERDESE2_1, ISERDESE2_10, ISERDESE2_11, ISERDESE2_12, ISERDESE2_13, ISERDESE2_14, ISERDESE2_15, ISERDESE2_2, ISERDESE2_3, ISERDESE2_4, ISERDESE2_5, ISERDESE2_6, ISERDESE2_7, ISERDESE2_8... and (the first 15 of 16 listed)
